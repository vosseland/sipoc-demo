CargoWise menus (Internal only)

This document outlines who the users are and the purposes of various menu options.









Introduction

This provides a high-level overview of the different menu options within CargoWise. Its designed to inform you of the industry and types of company or departments that use them.

CargoWise is an integrated platform designed to support single or multiple companies by utilizing a single shared database. 

Operate Menu

The Operate menu functions as the control center for the operations of a logistics companies. Below is an explanation of the modules:

Schedules

You’ve learnt that freight moves on different forms of transport, sea, air, road and rail. Each has a reference to identify the Vessel, Flight, Rail or Road movement they departed and/or arrived on. Examples include a flight number or the vessel name and voyage number. Each has their own arrival and departure estimate and actual dates and times. The Schedules module stores this information for jobs within CargoWise enabling centralized location for updating estimated and actual times of departures and arrivals.

Forwarding

This module is broken into a number of areas, these are associated with a Freight Forwarder and extra services they offer.

CFS/CTO

This module was originally designed for companies who pack or unpack containers. However it had limitations. WiseTech made the decision to replace it with other modules. 

Container Registration, Load Lists, Reports, Shipments and Tally has been replaced by Transit Warehouse module

Container Registration also falls under the new Container Yard module. Only available internally at the moment.

Gate Booking and Control are used by establishments that want to manage, record and control the entry and exit of vehicles to their establishment. Commonly used by CFS, depots, warehouses and container yards.




Forwarding

Much like a Travel agent organizes flights or holiday deals for an individual or family. A freight forwarder is similar. They are company or individual that arranges the shipping or importing of goods on behalf of shippers and or consignees. 

As freight can’t get from A to B or go through customs itself, the Freight Forwarder handles this on behalf of them. This is logistics, which may include transportation, warehousing, and customs clearance, ensuring that goods are transported efficiently and cost-effectively from origin to destination. Freight forwarders often consolidate shipments, negotiate with carriers, and provide documentation services, acting as intermediaries between the shipper and various transportation services. Just like a Travel Agent would do with tours and transfers etcetera.

Different options under this heading enable freight forwarders to manage different parts of their operations. For example Bookings is designed for Freight Forwarders who have a customer service team that take calls and manage bookings for clients.

Consol, Shipment and Containers modules are the most frequently used modules. They allow freight forwarders to record details such as:

who is sending and receiving the freight. 

The origin and destination country and city details.

create and store industry documents for the shipment.

keep a track an organize other parties associated with the logistics. E.g. transportation, warehouse, customs brokerage

Charge and enter costs for their services

Integrated with most of other modules in CargoWise which saves time rekeying data and avoid data entry errors. 

Order Manager

When clients order their products from overseas suppliers, they place a “purchase order”. This details terms and conditions of the purchase including the product details. Some clients pass this information to freight forwarders to manage on their behalf.

Two Order Manager systems exist; the original one launches CargoWise, while the more recent iteration is a web-based module with additional functionalities.

The Order Manager module enables freight forwarders to record and manage purchase order details and information. It connects to Neo which enables many parties, including the origin freight forwarder to update key information including dates. Through Neo, the client is able to view the latest information on their purchase without having to call the freight forwarder for details.

There are no invoicing or costing functions within order manager as its designed to connect to and/or create forwarding, customs and landed costings jobs so data isn’t required to be entered multiple times.

Customs

This module is used by forwarders and customs brokers to electronically communicate information with different government authorities. It enables forwarders and brokers to report products being exported or imported for statistical or tax and duty purposes.  

Integration exists with other modules to limit re-keying of data. As each country has different customs and border control requirements, the users logged in country determines what is displayed. Below are the key details of the Customs module. 

Customs

Commercial Invoice

Enables companies to enter or import the commercial invoice data for shipments for customs brokers to report and clear shipments for departure or arrival into a country. Invoices are used by brokers to determine the correct tariff classification of goods based on international trade regulations and customs tariffs. 

Customs Declarations

Enables customs brokers to create, submit, and track various customs documents required for import and export clearance, such as import/export declarations, customs invoices, and certificates of origin. 

Customs Global

Some countries require information be reported before goods arrive in the country to enhance border security, improve regulatory compliance and facilitate trade. The USA was the first to introduce this functionality called AMS or Automated Manifest System. It has since been expanded to other countries around the world.

This modules enables companies to enter the data required to report to the information to different country authorities.

Transport

Land and Port transport 

Designed for companies who manage a fleet of vehicles with drivers and/or subcontractors. Port Transport specializes in the movement of containers. Land Transport is better suited loose freight e.g. pallets and smaller packages. It can be used for Containers and is being developed more in this area. Both have mobile applications enabling information to be sent to the driver with instructions for pickups and or deliveries, GPS tracking and the ability to capture signatures for the receipt of goods. 

Transport Booking

Transport Booking enables modules within CargoWise to refine transport instructions and/or divide pickup and or delivery requirements for other module’s jobs, such as Forwarding and Customs. 

This information can be sent manually, via email, or electronically to a transport company, see Port and Land Transport, or another company to instruct them of the transport requirements. 

Refer to 

Warehouse

Originally starting as Product Warehouse, thus its name, it has been expanded into 3 different types of premises.

Container Yard

As containers are a very large item, most companies, such as shipping lines, out source the storage and management of them to another company. 

This module enables tracking of containers in and out of the premises and reporting to the owner. It also has a quality inspection system to ensure containers being returned are not damaged or require cleaning. It can create a quote and or order for a repair if damage was found. 

These services are billable to the owner of containers.

This only displays if turned on in Registry or accessed from the Global Dashboard.

Product Warehouse

Product Warehouse, also known as a 3PL Warehouse Manage System or WMS. 

This module manages the receipt, storage, pick, pack and dispatch products to business and consumers on behalf of other companies. Another example of 3PL Warehouse is Amazon, once you place your order, their WMS arranges the pick and pack. (Not the platform you buy the products from.)

As warehouses activities are predominately completed by humans, the overheads for wages can be costly. A WMS provides real-time data, facilitating better decision-making and reducing errors enabling warehouses to streamline operations, and improve efficiency and productivity. It can also help optimize the use of space, labor, and equipment by automating tasks such as tracking inventory, managing stock locations, and processing orders. 

This module can be used manually or integrated with other systems, such as Point of Sale (POS). 

Transit Warehouse 

This module is for a different type of warehouse to the Product (3PL). Once orders have been packed, the package is given an ID. This module is for warehouses or depots that manage the receipt and dispatch of packages, with IDs, in and out of a warehouse and/or pack and unpack containers, such as a depot or CFS.  Packages are labelled with identification numbers to ensure traceability from the moment it's received to the time it's dispatched.  

Transit Warehouse is integrated with CargoWise Forwarding, Shipment and Consol modules to send and receive information electronically. If electronic integration isn’t available, information can be entered manually.

Liner & Agency

This module is used by Shipping companies or agencies to manage bookings, space on ships and create carrier ocean bills of lading.

Ocean Carrier

This is a new module that is under development. It is only visible through a registry setting and will replace other modules.

Productivity Tools

The logistics industry predominately uses the other menu items under Operate or Manage, depending on their role. Large freight forwarders could use the Customer Service Tickets module to manage their own internal incidents/issues. Similarly, they could use Work Items and Projects to manage their miscellaneous requirements for offices much the way we do.




Manage

The Manage menu contains all modules outside of operational functions that the logistics companies use to run their business.

Sales & Marketing

A range of modules that enable logistics companies and sales teams to manage Campaigns, Inquiries, Opportunities, information about their competitors and Commission for sales people etc. 

Tariffs & Rates

CargoWise has a comprehensive rating system that enables freight forwarders to enter costs from service providers such as transport companies and rates either using a percentage mark up or individual rates. Companies can create a tariff or specific client rates. All are used to calculate costs and apply rates for services in different modules. 

Rates Service

Displays software rating  solutions WiseTech acquired and has integrated with CargoWise. 

Tariffs & Rates

Similar to the above, it is CargoWise original rating engine. It enable logistics companies to configure costs from service providers & rates that can be used to calculate charges on invoice for clients. One Off Quotes for most modules in CargoWise can be created here and also from the Bookings module. Profit Share agreements with other freight forwarders and special intercompany tariffs are also configured in this part of the system as they are rating related.

Business Intelligence & Analytics

The BI Manager module provides visibility of the configuration and health of major BI assets such as the Audit and Enterprise Data Warehouse databases, which provide data for use in various analytics and reporting purposes including operational reporting and the Audit Data tab shown in many CargoWise modules.

Workflow & Process

Is part of Workflow Manager and enables plan / prioritize work and enables users to see Exceptions, manage Job Workflows, see tasks assigned to you or another person.

This tool helps businesses track cash flow, maintain accurate financial records, and ensure efficient cash management.

Job Costing

For an accounts team or management, it allows users to manage and view the expenses and revenues associated with jobs, allowing businesses to see exactly how much each job costs and how profitable it is. The program helps manage and monitor these costs by providing detailed reports, ensuring that projects stay within budget and profitability can be analyzed accurately.

General Ledger

For an accounts team and management it provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial health, supports the creation of financial periods, journals and reports. It's essential for accurate financial reporting and effective financial management.

Budgets

For an accounts team and management, it allows a company/branch to outline the income and expenses over a specific period such as a month or year. It helps companies allocate resources, set financial goals, and monitor their financial performance. By comparing actual income and expenses to the budget, they can see if they are on track, overspending, or saving as planned. Budgets are crucial for managing money effectively, making informed financial decisions, and achieving financial stability and growth.



Asset Management

Is a tool designed to help companies track and manage their physical and intangible assets. This module keeps detailed records of assets such as devices, equipment and vehicles etcetera.

Maintain

The Maintain menu is where companies configure system data that is used by records in under the Operate and Manage menus. Examples include organizations, workflow templates, warehouses, customs and product info to name a few. Below it explains each in more detail. 

Information entered here can be entered when using the modules, an example is an Organization or Products in Customs or Warehouse modules.

Master Data

Although new organizations can be entered just about anywhere in the system where an organization is required to be entered. This is the central location where companies enter and manage organizational and contact/personal data. These are their clients, service providers, other logistics companies and competitors. Here they can also manage address authenticity or duplicate organization data.

Reference Files

Stores the master data for records used throughout the system. This is where you create manage and maintain source data for records such as Vessels, Currencies, Package Types, Service Levels, etcetera. Some Reference Files are maintained for compliance, particularly when sourced for electronic messaging, while others serve to minimize and standardize data entry.

Did you know that although the Interchange and Message information can be viewed here, services tasks need to be running to send or receive the messages. Refer to the  for more information.

Archive Manager

Archive Manager is a module in CargoWise that archives data globally. Archiving allows you to free up online database storage capacity and reduce SQL Server maintenance load. Its useful for companies that have been running CargoWise or its predecessor for some years and find that the size of their database is growing due to many jobs and related eDocs.

User Admin

This section enables companies to configure their company details. It also allows companies to configure staff, resources and groups, including security granting or restricting access to different parts or operations in the system.

Did you know CargoWise is a database that can be configured for multiple companies, some data is shared, such as jobs, organizations and reference files, however other data such as Accounting is Company and or Branch specific.  For more information refer to: 

System

Is where other general setup requirements are completed such as viewing emails and printer configurations and queues. Reports, for managing scheduled reports in the system and other system information and or configurations. 

Registry 

As CargoWise is one system that is highly configurable, the Registry enables companies to set up system wide configurations with different fall back levels to customize the system to their requirements. When a logistics company first gets a CargoWise system this is one of the first parts of the system that is configured along with Accounts information. Refer to 

Service Tasks

Service tasks manage automated processes. Most functions in CargoWise have a dedicated Service Task to schedule and run operational or administrative processes. Some examples include inbound and outbound mail, database backups, workflow event logs and triggers, inbound and outbound XML processing, and many more. Some Service tasks, particularly those used to process customs messaging, are country specific. As such, your list of active service tasks may vary according to your login country.

Other CargoWise modules

Within CargoWise some modules can be accessed from the menu screens. However there are others that may be of interest that aren’t as obvious. These modules have been built using the Glow Platform so can be found under the Global Dashboard (GHS). Its important to note that some are underdevelopment so not available to our general clientele.

Neo/Web Tracker

Neo will supersede Web Tracker. They are web applications that our clients give access to their clients to see track and see updates on their jobs, such as Order Manager.

Advanced Data Automation Wizard

The ‘Advanced Data Automation Wizard’, or ADAW, is a web-based importing tool that allows users to import file formats such as .csv, .xls and .xlsx into CargoWise. Data can be mapped to single or multiple tables of data using a single-level or multilevel file.

Carrier Contracts

Enables companies to manage Carrier Contracts. This is currently under development.

Human Resource Management

Currently under development, enables companies to manage employee training and development.

Ecommerce/eTail/HVLV

Designed for companies who move High Volumes of Low Value cargo, examples are courier type packages. Refer to 

Vehicle Booking System (VBS) & Gate Management 

VBS is a digital scheduling platform used by container terminals, empty parks, depots and warehouses. Its purpose is to manage and control truck arrivals, ensuring that container pickup and drop-off operations happen smoothly and efficiently.

Instead of drivers arriving at depots whenever they please (which can cause congestion, delays, and safety issues), the VBS requires transport operators to pre-book time slots for their vehicles. This gives depots visibility of upcoming demand and lets them plan their yard and labour resources accordingly.

The Gate Management module is for the facility to record the movement of trucks arriving, within or departing the premise and other control measures they may have.

Gate Management 



eAdaptor/eAdaptor Next/xHub/eHub
